🚀 Introducing LoyalLocal: Democratizing Loyalty Programs for Small Businesses

After seeing local businesses struggle with expensive loyalty systems, I built a solution that's:
• 100% free and open-source
• No app downloads required
• Phone-number based (works on any device)
• Perfect for salons, barbershops, cafes, and local eateries

🎯 How it works:
Customers simply provide their phone number at checkout. The business logs the visit, and customers can check their rewards anytime by visiting the web portal. When they earn a reward (e.g., "5 visits = 50% off"), they redeem it on their next visit.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
• Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks!)
• Supabase for backend & authentication
• Responsive CSS for mobile-first design
• Nigerian phone number validation built-in

💡 The Problem:
Small businesses lose ~65% of customers due to lack of engagement tools, but existing loyalty apps cost $50-500/month - prohibitive for most local businesses.

✨ The Solution:
A free, simple web app that takes 5 minutes to set up and requires zero technical knowledge.

🔗 Live Demo: https://imisioluwa3.github.io/LoyalLocal/

Would love to hear your thoughts, especially if you own a local business or work in the retail/service industry!

💈 Supporting Local Businesses, One Line of Code at a Time 💻

Hey everyone! I just launched LoyalLocal - a FREE loyalty rewards system designed specifically for local businesses like salons, barbershops, restaurants, and cafes! 🎉

🤔 Why did I build this?
We all love our local spots, but they can't compete with big chains that have fancy loyalty apps. Most loyalty systems cost $50-500/month - too expensive for small businesses. So I built a free alternative!

✨ How it works (it's SUPER simple):

FOR CUSTOMERS:
1. Visit your favorite local spot
2. Give them your phone number at checkout
3. Check your rewards anytime at the customer portal
4. Redeem when you've earned enough visits!

FOR BUSINESSES:
1. Sign up (takes 2 minutes)
2. Set your reward (e.g., "5 visits = free haircut")
3. Enter customer phone numbers after each visit
4. Watch your loyal customers come back more often!

🎯 No apps to download
🎯 Works on any phone
🎯 Free forever
🎯 Built with Nigerian phone numbers in mind (+234...)

## 📧 Email Announcement (For Developer Communities)

### Subject Line:
"Show HN: LoyalLocal - Free loyalty rewards for local businesses (phone-number based)"

### Body:
```
Hi everyone!

I built LoyalLocal - a free, open-source loyalty rewards system for local businesses.

🔗 Live: https://imisioluwa3.github.io/LoyalLocal/
📦 GitHub: [Your GitHub URL]

THE PROBLEM:
Local salons, barbershops, and cafes want to reward loyal customers but can't afford $50-500/month subscription apps. Existing solutions are too complex and expensive for businesses making <$10k/month.

THE SOLUTION:
A simple web app where:
- Customers provide their phone number (no app download)
- Businesses track visits via dashboard
- Customers check rewards via web portal
- When threshold is met (e.g., 5 visits), reward is earned

TECH STACK:
• Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks - keeping it simple)
• Supabase (backend + auth)
• Nigerian phone validation built-in
• Mobile-first responsive design

FEATURES:
✅ Customer portal - check rewards across all businesses
✅ Business dashboard - manage customers & settings
✅ Flexible rewards (e.g., "5 visits = 50% off")
✅ Phone number variations (handles +234, 0801, etc.)
✅ Fully responsive

WHAT I LEARNED:
Building without frameworks was refreshing! Also learned tons about Nigerian telecom prefixes (who knew there were 37 different ones?).

LOOKING FOR:
- Feedback from local business owners
- Code reviews from fellow devs
- Ideas for features v2

Open to all questions and suggestions!

Cheers,
[Your Name]

Title: "Built a free loyalty system for local businesses with Vanilla JS + Supabase"

Hey devs!

Just shipped LoyalLocal - a phone-number based loyalty rewards system for local businesses like salons and barbershops.

**Live Demo:** https://imisioluwa3.github.io/LoyalLocal/

**Why I built it:**
Local businesses in Nigeria (and elsewhere) struggle with customer retention but can't afford $50-500/month loyalty apps. I wanted to give them a free alternative.

**Tech Stack:**
- Vanilla JavaScript (no React/Vue - wanted to prove it's still viable!)
- Supabase (backend + auth)
- Responsive CSS
- Custom Nigerian phone validation utility

**Features:**
- Customer portal: Check rewards across all businesses
- Business dashboard: Track visits, manage settings
- Phone-based: No app downloads required
- Flexible rewards: "5 visits = 50% off" type programs

**What I learned:**
1. Building without frameworks is actually fun
2. Nigerian phone system has 37 network prefixes
3. Scroll-spy for navbar is trickier than I thought
4. Debouncing is your friend for scroll events

**Looking for feedback on:**
- Code structure (it's all vanilla JS)
- UX/UI improvements
- Security concerns (especially phone validation)
- Feature ideas for v2

**Source code:** [Coming soon - cleaning up for open source]

Happy to answer questions!

### First Comment:
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

Creator here. I built LoyalLocal after seeing my local barber struggle to remember regular customers. He wanted a loyalty system but couldn't afford the $300/month apps.

So I spent a weekend coding this solution:
✅ Free (always)
✅ No apps required
✅ Phone-number based
✅ Works on any device

Started with Nigerian businesses in mind (hence the +234 phone validation), but it works globally!

Happy to answer questions and would love your feedback! 🙏

What features would make this useful for YOUR local businesses?
